=Sitecore Delete Access Rights=
This package enables the "item:removeVersion" access right, 
allowing authors to remove individual item versions without 
allowing authors to delete the entire item. It also allows 
the initial creator of an item to delete his/her own item, 
unless an explicit deny delete access right is applied to 
the item.
